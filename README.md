is simple, user-focused, and built to facilitate conversations. Language learners can
log and review words from their daily encounters, while also having access to essential vocabulary terms
in areas like social services and emergency assistance. Inputted words and phrases become a card with
the equivalent translation pulled via API. Users can then study using a recall flashcard technique, and
optionally study with curated “essential vocab” packs designed for immigrant and refugee support.
